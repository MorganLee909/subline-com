I have updated the login and registration so that you can create an account and then login with it.

1.  Create an account and check the rest of the website.
    A lot of the work style that you changed affects every other page and breaks things.
    This is why I told you you really should not add style to "shared.css" unless you are absolute certain that you want it to affect every single page.
    You need to go through and get rid of all of these negative affects.
    Maybe go through "shared.css" and move all that code to the more local "landing.css"

Other than that, everything seems good to me.  Fix those side effects on the rest of the site and everything should be ready to go.
