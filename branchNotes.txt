v 1.  The login and register forms should not be partials because they are only used in one place.  
    Only use partials if they are going to be used in multiple places
    In the future we can easily turn them into partials if we need to reuse it.
    This also means that their css should be in the landing.css and not their own css file

v 2.  You have css in landing.css that applies to partials, this should never be.
    However, this will be solved once you fix #1, so you can ignore this problem

v 3.  The register strand does show the background picture, but the login strand does

v 5.  In shared.css, move .button-join class to the "header partial" section further down.  
    The button-join class is only found in the header

v6.  The "link" class that you created in shared.css is under the "banner partial" section.
    It is not part of the banner partial.  It needs to be moved to an appropriate place.  Probaby landing.css - moved to main area of shared.css since this should be apply to all pages.

7.  In shared.css.  You create style for h1, h3 and label.  This belongs near the top with all of the other general, site-wide style.
